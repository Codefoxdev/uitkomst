## Why use a Result type
There are a lot of ways your JavaScript code can break in production, one of the most frustrating ways is that methods can throw errors that you weren't expecting. Handling these errors is frustrating, and it is often unclear if a method can throw an error, let alone knowing what type of error it is.
This library aims to fix both of those points, it does so with a result type.

### Inspirations
This library is primarily inspired by the [gleam/result](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/result.html#partition) library. Most of those methods are also present in this library and are almost exactly the same as in gleam, for all the differences see [Comparison to gleam/result](#comparison-to-gleam/result).
### Comparison to gleam/result

| Gleam/result function | This library                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `all()`               | `result.all()`              | This method is implemented only on the static result object, as it uses a list of objects instead of a single instance.                                                                                                                         |
| `flatten()`           | `result.flatten()`          | Same reason as `all()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `is_error()`          | `instance.err`              | This method is renamed and a property instead of a function for more elegant code.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `is_ok()`             | `instance.ok`               | Same reason as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `lazy_or()`           | `instance.lazyOr()`         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `map()`               | `instance.map()`            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `or()`                | `instance.or()`             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `partition()`         | `result.partition()`        | Same reason as `all()`, as well as slightly different behaviour. Gleam's method returns the values in reverse order with respect to the position of the result in the array, this library doesn't, it is in the same order as the result array. |
| `replace()`           | `instance.replace()`        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `replace_error()`     | `instance.replaceErr()`     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -                     | `instance.tap()`            | This method doesn't exist in gleam, but can be useful for debugging purposes, when you simply want to print the inner value without modifying anything. It is the same as `map()`, but it doesn't change anything.                              |
| -                     | `instance.tapErr()`         | Same reason as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `then()`              | -                           | This method in Gleam is the same as `try()`, so it is removed in this library.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -                     | `instance.toPair()`         | Converts this result to a pair; an array of length 2, where the first item is the `Ok` value (or null) and the second item is the `Err` value (or null).                                                                                        |
| `try()`               | `instance.try()`            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `unwrap()`            | `instance.unwrap()`         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `unwrap_both()`       | `result.unwrapBoth()`       | This method is only available on the static result object, as it requires the `Ok` and `Err` types to be the same, which cannot be done on the instances.                                                                                       |
| -                     | `result.unwrapBothUnsafe()` | The same method as above, but doesn't require both types to be the same.                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `values()`            | `result.values()`           | Same reason as `all()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
